# **Things Buyer and Seller Agreed Upon Till Now**

1. **Land Portion for Sale:** *5 acres.*

2. **Joint 4 Acres:** *This includes a tubewell connected to a pipeline and a transformer pole.*\
   *(Note: Add a Google Maps screenshot to clearly demarcate the acres under consideration for sale. Specific location details needed to generate or reference the map.)*

3. **Water Share Allocation:** ***2 acres of water share*** *remains with Vipul.*\
   *If Naresh wants control over the irrigation tubewell, he pays up to 80 lakhs per acre, and the Soni-Dera water share transfers to Vipul's tubewell.*\
   *A pipeline from Vipul Dera to Soni Dera field is required (Vipul's son has a 2 kanal share in that).*\
   ***Pipeline cost responsibility (Vipul, Soni, or Naresh?) is not yet agreed upon.***

4. **Price Revision:** *The price requires adjustment to finalize the deal.*

5. **No Zero-Sum Situation:** *Both parties aim for a mutually beneficial outcome where neither profits at the other's expense.*\
   *(Refer to the inflation calculator at https://anandvip.github.io/inflation/ for reality checks; use growth rate or CAGR settings to assess inflation on deposited amounts.)*

6. **Handling Higher Rates:** *If higher rates are needed, Naresh can involve his network for investment, but initial documents only include Vipul and Naresh.*\
   *After the first stage, Naresh can handle his share documentation in a second stage independently.*

7. **Affordability Limit:** *Past meetings indicate the buyer cannot afford 1 crore per acre.*

8. **Payment Structure:** *The buyer can register at 60 lakhs per acre for 3 crores in white money (via NEFT bank-to-bank transaction against the buyer's bank loan; this is a stable methodâ€”if not possible, no deal, and the buyer can move on).*\
   *The remainder can be topped up with counted bank cash (beneficial for the seller for uses like kids' marriage, gold ornaments, shopping, and investments for daughter and future kids).*

9. *(Open for additional points as needed.)*
